# RetroPie-Podcatcher

this will install controls, playback menu's and a theme in RetroPie/emulationstation for any of the following podcatchers:

Podfox

https://github.com/brtmr/podfox
Podfox is a powerful little Python script that can update and download podcast episodes for you. First you’ll have to set a directory for downloads and decide how many episodes Podfox should download at once. Then you can subscribe to podcasts by providing a link to their feed. You can give every podcast a custom name, and update them one by one or all at once.

Podcatcher

https://github.com/doga/podcatcher
Even if you’re not usually a fan of command-line apps, you should give Podcatcher a chance. This versatile app can download both video and audio podcasts. Like gPodder, it can generate playlists from your podcast episodes for other apps and devices. Podcatcher can import subscriptions from an OPML file as well as from iTunes PCAST files. The best thing about Podcatcher is its range of options for downloading. You can control the total size of downloaded episodes, and Podcatcher will clean up old ones to make room for more. It offers several downloading presets or “strategies”, so you can retrieve just one episode or all episodes, everything released after (or before) a particular date, or just those episodes you haven’t downloaded before. You can also filter episodes by custom keywords before downloading them.


Greg

https://github.com/manolomartinez/greg
Greg is an interactive podcatcher for the console that uses simple, straightforward commands. You can use it to subscribe to podcasts, list currently available episodes, and download as many episodes as you want. Like Podcatcher, Greg relies on an application state file that “remembers” what you already downloaded. Old episodes can be removed manually. Greg can download audio and video content, but the latter needs to be enabled in the configuration file. Since you’re already there, you can check out other options, like filters and keywords for downloading only those episodes that contain them. The app’s GitHub page offers a detailed guide, explaining how to get started with Greg. 

Bashpodder

https://lincgeek.org/bashpodder/
BashPodder Was written and is maintained here by me (Linc) with the generous code contributions and great ideas of many of its users, some of whom have contributed modified scripts of their own. BashPodder is currently licensed under the GPL. BashPodder was written to be small and fast, and most importantly, to conform to the KISS rule (Keep It Simple Stupid). That way, anyone can add to and detract from the script to suit their own needs (and they are welcome to do so). BashPodder is listed in many places as a "Linux" podcatching client, and in fact, that is what I wrote it for initially, however, it should be noted that I have dozens of emails telling me how well it works on everything else, including but not limited to MaxOSX, Solaris, AIX, Net Open and FreeBSD, even windows and many other OS's I have forgotten I am sure. Bashpodder requires you have bash (but I have heard it runs fine under korn as well), wget and sed. As a bare minimum, you'll need the following three files: bashpodder.shell - The main program parse_enclosure.xsl - xsl style sheet to grab enclosure info bp.conf - The example podcast config list (containing some of my personal favorites)

Mashpodder
https://github.com/chessgriffin/mashpodder/
Mashpodder allows the user to download podcast episodes. The user can choose
to save these episodes in a named directory (i.e. separate directory per feed)
or in a date-based directory, so the most recent episodes are in one folder.
Or, the user can combine this by having some podcasts in a named directory and
others in the date-based directory. The user can choose to download all, none,
or a set number of episodes per feed. The user can also choose to mark the
episodes as downloaded (without actually downloading them) which can be used
to 'catch up' to a podcast.
